# zapier_vulnerability_notification_pipeline
Contains notes on how to have Zapier monitor the National Vulnerability Database for vulnerabilities in software packages you use. 
Step 5.  Obtain the cvedetails.com vendor ID and product ID numbers for each piece of software you want to monitor. (You'll use these in Step 6)
     5.a.  Navigate to https://www.cvedetails.com/  and in the big search bar at the top-center of the page, search for the application and select it from the search-bar's drop-down results list, which will take you to cvedetails' page on that application specifically.  
     5.b.  In the "Vulnerability Statistics" section, select the link labeled "Vulnerabilities(__)", where "__" actually contains a number representing the number of vulnerabilities that cvedetails has on file for that application.  This will navigate you to a page that contains a list of CVEs known for this application, and shows some metadata and a brief description for each CVE.  The URL for this page will contain the "vendor_id" and "product_id" numbers for this application - write those down. 
     5.c.  Repeat 4.a. & 4.b. for every software package you want to monitor. 
        NOTE:  You may find multiple vendor_id/product_id combos for a particular software package (EX:  there are several listings for Ubuntu).  Annotate all of the vendor_id/product_id combos you want to monitor for that package.  

Step 6.  Create a Zap in Zapier for each piece of software you want to monitor. 
     6.a.  Log in to Zapier.   
     6.b.  Click the red/orange-ish "Make a Zap!" button in the upper right corner area of the page.  This will bring up a 2-pane (side-by-side) page that guides you through the process of creating a Zap. 
     6.c.  "Choose a Trigger App"
     6.c.1.  search for "RSS" and select the "RSS by Zapier" app.  The pane will progress to "Select RSS by Zapier Trigger".  
     6.d.  "Select RSS by Zapier Trigger"
     6.d.1.  Click the "show less common options" link.  You should now see 2 radio-button options:  "New Item in Feed" and "New Items In Multiple Feeds".  
     6.d.2.  Select "New Item in Feed" if you have only one vendor_id/product_id combo to monitor for this software package.  Select "New Items in Multiple Feeds" if you have multiple vendor_id/product_id combos for this package.  
     6.d.3.  Select "Save & Continue".  The pane should progress to one titled "Set up RSS by Zapier Item".  
     6.e.  "Set up RSS by Zapier Item" 
     6.e.1.  "Feed URL":  paste the following link in that box and replacing its vendor_id and product_id numbers with the vendor_id and product_id numbers you wrote down in Step 5 for the package whose vulnerability alerts you want this zap to monitor: 
 https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-feed.php?vendor_id=15207&product_id=38977&version_id=0&orderby=3&cvssscoremin=0
(erase "15207" and replace it with your package's vendor_id number, erase "38977" and replace it with your package's product_id number)
     6.e.2.  "username":  leave blank (cvedetails.com does not require credentials to access its feeds).  
     6.e.3.  "password":  leave blank.
     6.e.4.  "What Triggers a New Feed Item" drop-down menu:  select "smart".  
     6.e.5.  Select the blue "Continue" button at the bottom right of the pane. The pane will progress to "Test RSS by Zapier".  
     6.f.  "Test RSS by Zapier" pane
     6.f.1.  select the "Fetch & Continue" button.  It should show that the test was successful, select the blue "continue" button at the bottom right of the pane.  If test not successful, double-check your URL, troubleshoot on your own.  The right pane will progress to "Choose an Action App". 
     6.g.   "Choose an Action App" pane
     6.g.1.  search for your project-management application (we use Jira) and select it from the drop-down menu.  The pane will progress to "Select ___[App name]___ Action".  From this point forth, if you use something other than Jira, you'll have to figure it out on your own.  I'll continue with the specifics for Jira.  
     6.h.  "Select Jira Action" pane
     6.h.1.  select the "Create Issue" radio button 
     6.h.2.  select the blue "Save & Continue" button at the bottom right of the pane.  The pane will progress to "Select Jira Account".  
     6.i.  "Select Jira Account" pane
     6.i.1.  select the gray "Connect An Account" button.  A new window will pop up titled "Allow Zapier to access your Jira account?"
     6.j.  "Allow Zapier to access your Jira Account" window
     6.j.1.  "Base URL":  Enter your company's Jira URL 
     6.j.2.  "Username":  enter username for the "Zapier Vulnerability Alerts" JIRA account you created in Step 3.  
     6.j.3.  "Password":  enter password for the "Zapier Vulnerability Alerts" JIRA account. 
     6.j.4.  "Save & Continue".  The right pane will progress to a new frame titled "Set up JIRA Issue".  
     6.k.  "Set up JIRA Issue" frame
     6.k.1.  "Project":  select appropriate project for your company's Jira architecture.  
     6.k.2.  "Issue Type":  select appropriate issue type for your company's JIRA architecture.  Consider having a Jira administrator create a new issue type for these vulnerability alerts.  
     6.k.3.  "Reporter":  leave empty.
     6.k.4.  "Summary":  select the drop-down button, then select the "Title" field, which should contain a CVE ID number.  Add a space behind that field in the "Summary" box and enter the software package's name.  It should look similar to:  "CVE-2017-7473 Ubuntu Vulnerability".  You can tailor it to say whatever you like and include whatever fields from the RSS feed you like, but I recommend keeping it brief; I'd liken it to the "subject" line of an email.  
     6.k.5.   "Due Date":  leave blank.  Zapier doesn't have a good way to automatically make the due date = +24 hours from the time the ticket is generated by the Zap.  
     6.k.6.  "Description":  select the RSS's "Description" field from the drop-down menu.  Add 2 newlines behind it, then use the drop-down list again to select the RSS's "Link" field.  Think of this as printing the vulnerability details in the email's message body, followed by the link to the vulnerability posting in the CVE List database (discussed in detail later).  
     6.k.7.  "Assignee":  select the JIRA group your JIRA administrator created for you in Step 2 for this particular software package.
     6.k.8.  "Priority":  Highest.  I consider this a "drop what you're doing and attend to this" issue, because I don't want harm to come to my customers or employees because I felt I was too busy to patch a publicly-known security vulnerability in a piece of software we use. 
     6.k.9.  "Labels":  add whatever 1-word labels you'd like.  These are tags that help your entries come up in searches in JIRA.  
     6.k.10.  select blue "Continue" button at bottom right of pane.  The pane will transition to a new frame titled "Send Test Issue to JIRA".  
     6.l.  "Send Test Issue to JIRA".
     6.l.1.  select the blue "Send Test to JIRA" button in the bottom right of the frame.  The pane will transition to a new frame titled "Test was successful!"
     6.m. "Test was successful!".
     6.m.1.  select blue "Continue" button in bottom right of frame.  The pane will transition to a new frame titled "Ready to turn on your Zap?" 
     6.n. "Ready to turn on your Zap?"
     6.n.1.  "Name yor Zap":  give the zap a name.  
     6.n.2.  "Your zap is":  click the grey "off" switch to change it to a green "on".  
     6.n.3.  select either the grey "See it on your dashboard" or the red "Make another Zap" button, whichever suits your situation. 

Repeat step 6 for every Zap you need to create.
